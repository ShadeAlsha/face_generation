# face_generation
a generator network that generates new images of faces that look as realistic as possible

In this project, I defined and trained a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. The goal is to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible. I used CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA) for the training.
